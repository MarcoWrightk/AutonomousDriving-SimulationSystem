# Testing Strategy

This system is validated through a multi-layered testing approach:

- **Unit Testing**:
Each module is tested in isolation to ensure correctness.

- **Integration Testing**:
Modules are tested together to validate communication and data flow.

- **Adversarial Testing**:
Inputs are corrupted or randomized to simulate edge cases and attacks.

- **Edge Performance**:
Latency and throughput are measured on Nvidia Xavier and Jetson platforms.

- **Safety Evaluation**:
Simulated collisions, evasive maneuvers, and risk scoring.

- **Sensor Fusion Validation**: Ensures temporal and spatial coherence across LiDAR, radar, and camera.
  
- **Weather Resilience**:
Models are tested under simulated rain, fog, snow, and low-light conditions.

- **RL Agent Evaluation**: Tracks convergence, stability, and decision quality over time.

Tools used: `unittest`, `pytest`, `JMeter`, `Fuzzing`, `CARLA`, `ROS`, `Prometheus`, `TensorBoard`
